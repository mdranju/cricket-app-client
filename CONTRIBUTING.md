## How to Contribute

1. **Create a Feature Branch**  
   Branch off from `main` with a descriptive name:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/add-player-search-filter
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**

   - Implement your feature or fix.
   - Ensure your code passes linting and tests (see below).
   - Update any relevant documentation (e.g., README.md).

3. **Commit Your Changes**

   - Provide a clear description of your changes, including motivation and any related issues.
   - Link to any issues this PR addresses (e.g., "Closes #123").

We use GitHub Actions for CI/CD, so your PR will be automatically tested. Merges require at least one approval.

## Code Style and Linting

We strive for consistent, readable code. Our style is enforced via:

- **ESLint**: For JavaScript/TypeScript linting. Run `npm run lint` to check.
- **Prettier**: For code formatting. Run `npm run format` to auto-format.
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing is required.

Before committing, run:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
npm run format
```

Ignore files are handled by `.gitignore` and `.eslintignore`. New components should follow patterns in `src/components/`.

## Testing

Tests are crucial for maintaining quality. We use:

- **Jest** and **React Testing Library** for unit and integration tests.
- **Cypress** for end-to-end tests (optional for now).

1. Write tests for new features or bug fixes in `__tests__` folders.
2. Run tests with `npm run test`.
3. Aim for >80% coverage on new code.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- **Small and Focused**: Keep PRs to a single concern (e.g., one feature or bug fix).
- **Descriptive Title**: Use action-oriented titles (e.g., "fix: resolve live score update lag").
- **Description**: Include:
  - What and why.
  - How to test.
  - Screenshots/GIFs if UI changes.
- **Rebase on Main**: Ensure your branch is up-to-date with `main`.
- **Squash Commits**: If needed, squash into logical units before merging.

PRs are reviewed promptly. Expect feedback within a few days.
